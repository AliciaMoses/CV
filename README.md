## Alicia Moses

I am a long-time hobbyist coder turned full-stack developer, with a genuine curiosity for all things technology and innovation.

My experience in creating diverse web and desktop applications has strengthened my programming and design skills. 

I value a creative process that is both inspired and grounded in design principles, leading to engaging and inclusive user experiences. 

I'm also enthusiastic about data-driven approaches, striving to find the right harmony between imaginative solutions and logical thinking. 

As a recent Makers Academy graduate, I'm eager to grow my skillset and collaborate on projects that explore new technologies and focus on user-centered solutions.

## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
